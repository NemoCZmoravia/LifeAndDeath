# LifeAndDeath
A spigot plugin for dying in various ways. lol

## Life of a player
= A description of how the plugin should work when it's done.

### Birth
A limited amount of "unborn" players can join the server and enter the birth queue.

When a mother gets in her final pregnancy stage and lies on a bed a new player spawns next to her and gets a randomly assigned gender.
He only has 6 (out of 20) lives to begin with.
He will gain the rest of his lives as he grows up during the next 5 hours he spends online.

### Adulthood
An adult player has full health.

### Conception
When two players of opposite gender lay down next to each other in beds a pregnancy begins. / (has a certain chance to begin?)

### Pregnancy
A woman is pregnant for 3.75d.
During a pregnancy the women can't sprint and takes slightly more damage.
During the last 6 hours a new player can join and be born.

#### Giving birth
When a new player joins at this stage the mother is alerted to get in bed before it's to late. (She has about 5 minutes.)
As soon as she gets there a new player gets teleported to her and "born".

There is a delay of about 1 irl day of playtime before she can get pregnant again.

### Naming
The mother can then name the newborn. If she doesn't do so. The new player can choose a name after he reaches his teens.
An adult player can change his name any time.


### Aging
During the last 3 months of players life his lives gradually decrease down to zero.

There could be some kind of e reward for dying of old age.

## Necromancy (addon?)
When a player dies he has a choice to remain a ghost (some kind of spectator mode) and wait if someone doesn't try to "revive" him.

A revived player is completely dependent on his master.
- If the master dies the revived die with him and turn into a ghosts again.
- There could be a command for killing whoever one revived.
- If the master hasn't logged on since x amount of time the revived get kicked and can't rejoin.
