# LiveAndDeath
A spigot plugin for dying in various ways. lol

## Life of a player
= A description of how the plugin should work when it's done.

### Birth
A limited amount of "unborn" players can join the server and enter the birth queue.

When a mother gets in her final pregnancy stage and lies on a bed a new player spawns next to her and gets a randomly assigned gender.
He only has 6 (out of 20) lives to begin with.
He will gain the rest of his lives as he grows up during the next 5 hours he spends online.

### Adulthood
An adult player has full health.

### Conception
When two players of opposite gender lay down next to each other in beds a pregnancy begins. / (has a certain chance to begin?)

### Pregnancy
A woman is pregnant for 3.75d.
During a pregnancy the women cant sprint and takes slightly more damage.
During the last 6 hours new players can join and be born.

#### Giving birth
When a new player joins at this stage the mother is alerted to get in bed before it's to late. (She has about 5 minutes.)
As soon as she gets there a new player gets teleported to her and "born".

There is a delay of about 1 irl day of playtime before she can get pregnant again.

### Aging
During the last 3 months of players life his lives gradually decrease down to zero.
